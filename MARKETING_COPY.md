## Elevator Pitch

### 30-Second Pitch
StickyToDo is a powerful macOS task manager that combines proven GTD methodology with visual board planning. What makes us different? Your data stays in plain-text markdown files that you can edit in any app, version control with git, and sync anywhere—no vendor lock-in, no cloud dependency. With 21+ advanced features including Siri Shortcuts, automation rules, and time tracking, StickyToDo delivers enterprise power while respecting your data ownership.

### 10-Second Pitch
GTD task management with visual boards, all backed by plain-text markdown. You own your data forever.

---

## Value Propositions

### Core Value Props

#### 1. Data Ownership
**Problem**: Traditional task managers lock your data in proprietary formats. If the service shuts down or changes pricing, you lose everything.

**Solution**: StickyToDo stores all data in plain-text markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Your tasks are readable in any text editor and will never be trapped.

**Benefit**: Peace of mind knowing your productivity system is future-proof and under your control.

**Key Message**: *"Your data should outlive any app—including ours."*

---

#### 2. Dual-Mode Workflow
**Problem**: List-based apps are great for GTD processing but lack visual planning. Board apps are great for brainstorming but lack GTD structure.

**Solution**: StickyToDo gives you both. Work in traditional list views for GTD discipline, or switch to visual boards for spatial thinking—same tasks, different views.

**Benefit**: Use the right tool for the job without managing multiple apps or duplicating data.

**Key Message**: *"Lists when you need structure. Boards when you need to see the big picture."*

---

#### 3. Plain-Text Philosophy
**Problem**: Proprietary file formats create dependency on specific apps. Can't edit in your preferred tools, can't automate, can't version control.

**Solution**: Every task is a markdown file. Edit in VS Code, Obsidian, vim, or any text editor. Use git for version control. Run scripts to batch process tasks.

**Benefit**: Ultimate flexibility and power-user capabilities without breaking the app.

**Key Message**: *"Your favorite text editor is now your task manager."*

---

#### 4. No Cloud Dependency
**Problem**: Cloud-based services require internet, raise privacy concerns, have monthly fees, and can shut down without warning.

**Solution**: StickyToDo works entirely offline. All data stored locally. Sync optionally via Dropbox, iCloud, or any file sync you control.

**Benefit**: Privacy, speed, reliability, and control over your data location.

**Key Message**: *"Your tasks stay on your Mac. Share them (or don't) on your terms."*

---

#### 5. Complete GTD Implementation
**Problem**: Many task managers claim GTD support but lack key perspectives, defer dates, or proper weekly review workflows.

**Solution**: Full implementation of Getting Things Done methodology: Inbox, Next Actions, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe, contexts, projects, perspectives, and weekly review.

**Benefit**: Trust your system knowing it supports the complete GTD workflow you rely on.

**Key Message**: *"GTD done right. David Allen would approve."*

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "Why not just use markdown files in VS Code?"

**Response**: You absolutely can! StickyToDo uses the exact same markdown files. The difference is we add:
- Visual boards for spatial planning
- Quick capture with natural language parsing
- Automated recurring tasks
- Full-text search with filtering
- Weekly review workflow
- Calendar integration
- Siri Shortcuts

Think of it as a powerful GUI on top of your markdown files, not a replacement for them. You can still edit in VS Code anytime you want.

---

### Objection 2: "Plain-text storage seems limiting for advanced features"

**Response**: Surprisingly, YAML frontmatter in markdown is incredibly flexible. We store:
- All metadata (projects, contexts, priorities, dates)
- Board positions for each task
- Recurrence patterns
- Time tracking entries
- Subtask relationships
- Automation rules

Plus, because it's all in structured YAML, you can write scripts to process tasks programmatically. Try that with a proprietary database!

---

### Objection 3: "I need iOS support for on-the-go task management"

**Response**: Valid concern. Our v1.0 focuses on macOS excellence. However:
- **Now**: Edit your markdown files on iOS using Working Copy, iA Writer, or any markdown editor
- **v2.0** (2026): Native iOS/iPadOS apps with iCloud sync

The advantage of plain-text is you're never locked out of your data—use any iOS markdown app while waiting for our official iOS app.

---

### Objection 4: "What if your company shuts down?"

**Response**: This is exactly why we chose plain-text storage. If StickyToDo disappears tomorrow:
- Your tasks are still in readable markdown files
- You can edit them in any text editor
- You can write scripts to process them
- You can import them into other tools
- Your data outlives our app

Compare that to proprietary formats where you're stuck if the company closes.

---

### Objection 5: "Isn't $20 expensive for a task manager?"

**Response**: Let's compare:
- **Todoist Premium**: $48/year = $240 over 5 years
- **OmniFocus**: $99/year = $495 over 5 years
- **StickyToDo**: $19.99 one-time = $19.99 over forever

Plus, with plain-text storage, you can stop using our app anytime and keep your data. No subscription lock-in, no recurring fees, no price increases.

You're not just buying an app—you're buying ownership of your productivity system.
