## Writing Style Matching Guide

### How to Mirror Formality Level

**If posting is Formal:**
- Use complete sentences, no contractions
- Professional vocabulary (utilize vs. use, commence vs. start)
- Structured paragraphs
- Third-person or restrained first-person

**If posting is Professional-Collaborative:**
- Clear, direct language
- Active voice
- Strategic use of "I" and "we"
- Balance professionalism with warmth

**If posting is Casual:**
- Conversational tone
- Contractions okay
- Show personality
- Shorter sentences

### Vocabulary Alignment Techniques

**Extract their key verbs and mirror them:**

Job posting uses: "stewarded", "cultivated", "advanced"
Your cover letter: Use same verbs (if authentic to your experience)

**Adopt their terminology:**

Job posting: "stakeholder engagement"
Your materials: Use "stakeholder engagement" (not "relationship management")

Job posting: "evidence-based decision-making"
Your materials: "evidence-based" (not just "data-driven")

### Sentence Structure Matching

**Analyze their sentence patterns:**

**Short, punchy (tech/startup):**
"We're growing fast. You'll lead our expansion. Impact is immediate."
→ Your cover letter: Similar short sentences, energy

**Longer, thoughtful (academic/nonprofit):**
"This role offers the opportunity to contribute to our mission of advancing
equitable access to transformative artistic experiences while building
sustainable community partnerships that honor our institutional values."
→ Your cover letter: Similar sentence length, thoughtful flow

**Balanced (most professional settings):**
Mix of sentence lengths, clear but not choppy
